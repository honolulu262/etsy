"vintage fabric, Tan/Beige Houndstooth Polyester Fabric, 1960 Era fabric 65"" wide, vintage fabric retro houndstooth fabric project fabric","I recently have found enjoyment searching for vintage fabrics ( my daughter got me started on this new search!)   I don't claim to be an expert in the area of sewing at all....the extent of my knowledge was making a pair of pants in 4 H with 1970's fabric~ so I applaud those of you who are talented in this area!! 

This piece of fabric is great for those who love to sew vintage clothing OR to use with up- cycled projects !  Fabric HAS not been laundered, but is clean, stain free, hole -free  and SMOKE FREE!  Side edges are straight, ends have not been cut exactly straight, but close ( see pic) . The side edges appear to have been stitched together  and then the stitches removed as there are stitching holes along the sides ( see photo) , but again,... my sewing knowledge is limited so it could be from something else!   Backside of the fabric is a solid beige/tan - front is a houndstooth pattern in the same coloring  . 

Coloring ~  Beige

Pattern~  Houndstooth 

Width ~  65"" 

Length  ~ 124"" long

Fabric  ~ Polyester

Insides of plates have raised circles with fish designs circling the outer portion.  Middle of the plate has a raised circle - perhaps these are actually saucers…. I am not entirely for sure.  Plates have some slight scuffing markings noted - this is more so on the yellow plate ( see photo) .

No makers markings noted - backs of plates have firing pin markings ( see photos)

Measures approximately:  60"" long x 52"" wide at the top of the afghan .... and 70 "" wide towards the bottom  
This piece is not exactly square with straight edges. It appears that the top portion of the blanket is narrower than the bottom.  Im guessing that when it was being made they lost count and added more stitches at the bottom!  Never the less, it is a great afghan for tossing on the couch or to use as a lap blanket! 
Center of blanket has a white square ( see last photo) 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content.  Afghan is heavy, not lightweight! 

VERY GOOD preowned condition  - no stains, tears or damage !  Only very slight piling of the yarn is noted.  This piece has been laundered and washed up nicely!

VERY GOOD vintage condition: no chipping or crazing or crackling. Glaze is bright and shiny- rim is smooth - the outer portion of the bowl has a few some pin point indentions in the bowl- from manufacturing of this time era . There is one area near the rim where the glaze did not adhere to the pottery - this appears as a chip, but it is not. 

This bowl is in great shape considering its age ! 

Bottom has a faint indention - but can't make out what it says - appears to be an M - guessing it is a McCoy 

The bowl is  8 1/2 "" wide, and stands 4"" tall

Nice addition for your country farmhouse ~ I love using these bowls to serve cut up fruit or pasta salad in!

"Antique Neoclassical Three Face Covered Clear and Frosted Glass Candy Dish Compote LG Wright, collectible glass pedestal bowl with lid","Vintage clear and frosted glass Three Face covered compote candy dish is also known as Three Fates, Three Graces and Three Sisters. 

This design was introduced by John Ernest Miller, mold-shop superintendent for George Duncan and Sons in Pittsburgh, PA, and is rumored to be a likeness of his wife Elizabeth. The design was patented in June of 1878 and was originally called pattern No. 400. L. G. Wright Glass Company produced copies of the design in the late 1960’s. 

Ladies features, hair and jewelry are detailed and crisp. The stem and base of the piece are acid finished giving them a frosted appearance and a satiny feel. The lid and bowl are clear glass.

VERY GOOD vintage condition with no chips or cracking. Faces show no rough spots or nicking. 

The compote measures 6 1/4” in diameter and is 4 1/2” tall without the lid. With the lid in place, the piece measures approximately 8 1/2” tall. The diameter of the base is approximately 3 3/4”.

Taken from the blog above : 
The history behind this unique style of dishware is a great American story about a once thriving pottery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Tennessee.  Although our current inventory of Blue Ridge is limited, our appreciation at Southern Vintage Table for this American-made china is growing!
The story begins in the early 1900s when a railroad company sold a large parcel of land along their railroad line in Erwin, Tennessee to a group of investors. There were rich deposits of kaolinite and feldspar nearby, perfect ingredients for a pottery business. According to Wikipedia, in 1916 Clinchfield Potteries opened their doors for business, manufacturing the typical china style of the times which were described as “gold-trimmed, decal-decorated dishes”.
In the 1920s the business was sold and became known as Southern Potteries. To set his style of china apart from his competitors, the new owner introduced a hand painted, underglaze technique. The bold, new patterns, painted by the local women, were stamped with the new label, Blue Ridge, sometime during the 1930s.

Measures approximately: 70"" long x 48"" wide

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content ~ it has some stretch to it and is heavy weight.  Stitches are close together ~ I believe this is knitted, but I am not entirely sure.  My crafting skills are not honed into the different between crocheting and knitting ! 

Slight piling ( wear) of the yarn is noted.  
Edges are not perfectly straight - this is a sure sign of a hand made piece :)

This piece has been laundered and washed up nicely with no odors, stains, loose stitches or tears!

FRANCISCAN EARTHENWARE
MADE IN U.S.A
OVEN SAFE/COLOR FAST

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised pink rose pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

"Vintage Hexagon Star quilt hand stitched yellow gold white quilt STAR pattern Handmade Dolly Madison quilt gold star white flour sack 1940s","GORGEOUS vintage hand stitched Star quilt ~ with gold and white coloring 

I am told that the pattern is a Hexagon star or Dolly Madison star. 
The oldest published name for this pattern combining a hexagon, a diamond and a 5-sided shape seems to be Hexagonal Star from Hearth and Home magazine about 1910.  ( Barbara Brackman)

Measures approximately 82"" x 75""

Blanket is clean and odor free 

Gently used vintage condition  - gorgeous coloring - some fraying of material along the edges along with some small tears in the white fabric ( mostly along the sides) - this is from normal aging - see photos - no staining or large rips in the piece. 

Back side of quilt is all white - possibly white flour sack material 

This piece was acquired at an estate sale of an elderly lady ( 90 +) who passed ~ the daughters said that their mother made the quilt when she was in her early 20s 

BEAUTIFUL display piece for any farmhouse decor !

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised pink rose pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

Marking dates 1958 - 63 

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised pink rose pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

All are heavy plates with muted colors and a shiny glaze  -no crazing in the glaze from age is noted.  All plates are free from cracks.   HOWEVER, there a a few tiny Knicks in the colored gaze on the yellow and white plate ( see photos)

"Vintage fireking Golden Anniversary dish set, wedding table dishes, vintage milk glass w/ gold rim, bridal registry, vintage fireking dishes","** PRICE IS FOR TWO - 5 piece PLACE SETTINGS  **

~ Fire King's Golden Anniversary - an ivory swirl with heavy gold border. This pattern was produced in the mid fifties to commemorate their 50 years of business. 

Each setting contains 5 pieces 

1 Dinner plate  ~ 9 1/8""
1 Salad plate  ~  7  3/4""
1 berry bowl   ~   4  3/4""
1 saucer        ~   5  3/4""
1 cup     ~   3  3/4 in diameter 

These vintage -opaque white -milk glass FIRE KING dishes are in VERY GOOD/ EXCELLENT condition ~ they show very little wear for their age-  22 Kt gold rim is beautiful and shows minimal fading - salad plates show more wear than others.  Gold edging is not a solid rim of gold, but instead is more of a ""gold spray"" on the rims of the dishes.  I have seen many other pieces similar to these , but usually the gold is faded and worn. These pieces have no chips or cracking.  There are some variations in coloring if you look closely - some are whiter than others, while some have a yellow hue to them from aging. NOTE - Gold on some salad plates show slight wear compared to the gold trim on the other pieces. 

(I wouldn't suggest placing them in the dishwasher as that will make the gold fade- these dishes must be hand washed ) 

Bottoms of all pieces are marked : 
OVEN FIREKING ( in script) WARE MADE IN THE USA ( marking dates dishes from 1951 - 1960) 

** Alaska and Hawaii residents please convo me for an accurate shipping amount prior to purchasing - this shipping rate does not apply to your areas

I also have a set of 4 place settings available - these show more gold wear.

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix.  Afghan is medium weight 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Light piling of the yarn is noted in some places on the blanket. There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see photos) . Some random stray hairs maybe noted on the blanket from the previous owner.  

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

Circa :  1956 - 1982

Description: RED/GREEN ROOSTER, GREEN LINE, RED DOTS

VERY GOOD vintage condition considering their age!!!  
Handles are delicate and should be carefully handled when washing- using cool water... I had one come off in my hand because I wasn't gentle enough and used hot water  :( Im wondering if they used a glue to secure them on  the cups??  I have taken a photo of the handle up close for you to look at . 
Glaze is intact and there is NO crackling - I washed each piece and no water seeped through the glaze on any of the pieces.   No chips, cracks, staining or repairs.

How to care for your Hat :

*Always handle your hat by the brim. (Do not pinch the crown to pick it up as this will result in misshapen crowns and may split the felt.)

*Never rest your hat on its brim. Always turn it upside down and set it on the crown, so that the brim doesn’t flatten out.

*Clean your hat regularly using a soft bristle brush or a hat sponge.

*Brush counter clockwise with the nap, starting at the bow. If you get caught in the rain, turn the sweatband out and let the hat stand on the crown until dry.

*Never apply direct heat to your hat as this will cause it to shrink and/or lose it’s shape.

* Always store your hat in a hat box to help keep it clean and looking new.

"6 vintage Royal Ruby red punch cups, vintage Anchor hocking Royal Ruby glass tea cups, Mid century red glassware, red glass mugs, red glass","Listing cost is for SIX punch cups in the Royal Ruby red color. 

Cups measure approximately 3 1/4"" in diameter and 2 1/2"" in height and hold 6 ounces 

They are in very good condition with no chips, nicks or cracks - rims are smooth to the touch! One cup has a slight fleabite on the rim that has been sanded down to smooth. Glass is bright and shiny - no clouding .  When held to direct lighting, they may show some very light surface scratching from gentle use.

Hocking introduced their Royal Ruby colored glassware in 1938 and it's proven popular over the years. The bright splash of color makes a wonderful holiday decoration, especially when pared with Forest Green.

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Zig Zag pattern knitted blanket Brown Pastel yellow Retro sofa throw Mid Century Lodge decor","~ Vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled Chevron in a ZIG ZAG pattern of brown and pastel yellow  Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor ~

Beautifully crafted vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with zig zag pattern! 

Measures approximately : 78"" long x 34"" wide - with a 3 1/2"" fringe .
The material has slight stretch to it.  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight.  This would make a nice lap blanket ~ or a throw for a pop of colors - blanket has more of a narrow long shape than wide. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix.

GOOD preowned condition- no tears or holes. Blanket shows piling of the yarn ( see photos).  There is an area on the corner of the blanket that shows discoloration on the front and back.  Appears to have been a stain or where the yarn was bleached - see last two photos. 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

"Vintage Old Metal Street White Black Sign Antique Road Name Sign E FOURTH ST Metal Wall Decor Hanger Industrial Rustic Shabby Chic 1940s","Listing is for one vintage metal street sign hand painted with ""E FOURTH  STREET"" in raised black lettering.

Very solid and heavy, beautiful weathered look perfect for your shabby chic decor!!

Measures: 24"" wide by 6"" tall 

The ends of the sign have a hole for attaching the sign to a wall or board ~ rusting is noted on this piece. The black lettering is distressed and some areas show loss. White background coloring is chalky and leaves some residue on your finger if you run it across the sign, however most of the white on the face of the sign is worn.  Sign is made of heavy metal. 

Solid and strong with a real nice rustic / industrial look and feel ~. You can notice brush strokes on the bottom of the sign and on lettering - the sign appears to have been handprinted and dates from the 1940's.

I have more street signs to be listed....   E First, W Fifth, Seventh, Eleventh, E Eleventh.

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. It is a thinner yarn than most, so the blanket is lighter and not super thick. 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no fading, staining, rips or damage!  Little to no piling of the yarn ~ edges have some light fuzzing - see photos.  Lovely piece with retro 1970 colors ~ perfect for any RETRO decor ! 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

"2 Vintage GOLD round stoneware Fondue Sushi plates mustard yellow ceramic grill plates, Mid century JAPAN divided plates MCM Fondue platters","Price is for a Set of TWO  plates 
* 5 sets of 2 available * 

9.5"" round stoneware Sushi - fondue plates in the muted color mustard yellow

GOOD vintage condition -NOTE plates have crazing in the glaze from age, but this adds to the overall vintage look.  I ran water over them to see how deep the crackling went, and it is only surface crackling in the glaze  - did not soak to the stoneware part of the plate.  All plates are free from chips, staining  and cracks.  

All plates have the number 0-4000 stamped on the backs , but no makers name to identify the exact date or origin of manufacture. 

I LOVE the coloring of these plates....if you aren't into fondue or sushi , the great coloring makes them perfect for display in any vintage kitchen  or would make awesome grilling plates!

"Medium vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Burgundy, Pink Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","Beautifully crafted Medium vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan / blanket with a stripped chevron / zig zag pattern ! 

Gorgeous colors, three shades of pink, and Burgundy !

Measures approximately ~ 44 "" long x 60"" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix as there is some stretch to the yarn. 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Slight piling of the yarn noted. Edges are damage free - no holes ! 

This piece has been laundered and air dried and is odor free!

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company. The company was purchased by Interpace and produced a line of glassware (Madeira) to complement the Franciscan dinnerware patterns. The final end came to the company in 1980 when production ceased.

"Extra Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket, Blue Green Diamond Argyle design Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","Beautifully crafted EXTRA LARGE vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a diamond pattern of shades of 2 blues and 2 greens

Measures approximately : 100"" long x 60"" wide - material has stretch to it. These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. It has some weight to it as well as thickness ! 

Excellent preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage!  Little to no piling of the yarn. There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish and some random stray hairs can be found on the piece.  Last photo shows the afghan when it is all stretched out. 

This piece has been laundered and air dried, so I can assure you it is clean and odor free.  This comes from a smoke free home.

GREAT vintage condition - no damage of any kind.  Crate has original stamps on the top from when it was shipped…. hard to imagine shipping eggs!! Wood is seasoned and has a nice patina. There are no cracks or missing slats.  Wooden handle is functional and sturdy. Lid comes on and off easily 

The inside of the crate has ONE original cardboard tray and padding for the eggs to sit. All are in good condition for their age - some small hole in one of the egg cushions and the egg holder has some areas of wear ( see photos) .
There is some dust that comes with it as it has been on display in my home for years - I am working on downsizing! 

Great piece for display in your farmhouse!!!

HEAVY PIECES ~ Check out other FRANKOMA pieces that I have listed in my shop! 

Here's a tidbit about this pottery : 
Frankoma Pottery was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma 1933. John Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year.[3] The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma.

"4 vintage Franciscan Crystal Madeira TIFFIN Plum footed juice goblets vintage purple glass goblets retro purple Tiffin Madeira replacements","GORGEOUS!!!! 

FOUR (4) Vintage Franciscan Madeira TIFFIN  PLUM  footed juice goblets

Discontinued glass 
Circa - 1972 - 1976

Made of heavy glass  ~ in EXCELLENT vintage condition- I would almost say MINT!* One glass appears to have a hairline crack on the inside of the bowl at the bottom. It does not go through to the outside of the glass because of the thickness of the glass. See last photo .

They appear to have had little to no use - Great shine on the inside of glasses - no scratching , chips, cracks or cloudiness , rims are smooth to the touch. 

Stands approximately 4 7/8"" tall with a 3"" diameter -  They are not all the exact same height ( see last photos) 
Holds approximately 6 ounces when filled to the rim! 

Beautiful PURPLE  coloring on these retro beauties :)

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company.

It would be a great addition to your collection or just to  add some color to your kitchen !

The metal screw caps shows some denting ~ but each lid fits solidly on the shaker- it is not stripped. The black & silver sticker with the lettering that says SALT / PEPPER is in EXCELLENT condition.  Inside rim of the pieces are free from chips or cracks.  The pepper shaker has a straw line on the back from manufacture - this is not a crack, but a line in the glass ( see last photo) 
Bottoms are different on each shaker ( see photos) 

No makers markings noted ~ appears to be made of Milk Glass Vitrock ~ This is opaque, solid white.

History : 
 Cathrineholm of Norway is responsible for the simple and attractive enamelware that was a staple in households across Scandinavia and America in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Their iconic lotus pattern is their most recognizable, and a classic of mid-century modern design. The designer responsible for this striking collection was a woman by the name of Grete Prytz Kittelsen. Kittelsen, often referred to as the “Queen of Scandinavian Design,” was known for her beautiful work with sterling, enamel, and other metals. Her designs earned her numerous awards, as well as well-deserved attention as an inspiration and integral part of the Scandinavian Design movement.

"4 vintage pink purple wine glasses, pink long stemmed goblets Libbey premier Plum Pink, vintage pink wine water glasses for wedding toasting","**See pull down menu for purchasing options ~ glasses are available in sets of 4 or individually **

Positively pretty in  PINK!!!  

Libbey Premiere Pattern Plum White Wine Glasses made in the USA of light plum colored glass. 
** 16 sets of 4 available - plus 2 single glasses **

Each is approximately 7 1/4-inches tall overall with the bowl of the goblet being 4-inches deep and 2-inches in diameter at the rim. 

 Made of heavy glass - not thin and delicate.  Glasses  holds 8-oz of the beverage of your choice !

Bottoms of the glasses are marked with the  Libbey mark (script ""L"") in a circle - glasses have a nice ring to them when you flick them with your finger !

ALL glasses are in VERY GOOD  vintage condition with no cracks  or chips and the plum color is wonderful. Rims are smooth to the touch. Glass is shiny with no cloudiness - there are some random water marks on a few glasses - they are in need of  a good soak- since they have been gently use- there maybe some very slight surface scratches that can be seen if held to the direct light. I have not noticed this on these gorgeous glasses, but want to make sure the buyer understands that these glasses are vintage and have been gently used :)

"Antique Mason Jar Ball Eclipse Wide Mouth Canning Jar  Fruit Jar farmhouse decor Clear Glass Wide Mouth Storage Jar Vintage Quart Size Jar","SOLD INDIVIDUALLY 
**2 available **

LOVE LOVE LOVE the possibilities for this depression era canning jar ~ great for any farmhouse decor

Circa  1933 to 1962 

BALL ECLIPSE WIDE MOUTH canning jar with original glass lid and wire baling closure . This style of jar was only made for a brief period and the manufacturing of wide mouth jars was halted during WWII. 

EXCELLENT vintage condition - metal wiring shows little to no wear- some corrosion and slight rust is noted on some, but is functional and holds the lids securely onto the jars.  The Eclipse style of jar has a matching clear glass lid secured by a metal wire bail. Glass is clean and free from cracks or clouding. Small air bubbles in the glass of jars; this is very common with the glass used for older mason jars. Jars have mold seams and straw marks present in glass. Straw marks are dents and mold marks in the glass and are the result of the manufacturing process and are not post-production damage. The underside of the jars have a ringed base and are marked with a number in the center of the jar base. I can not make out these numbers. 

Jar contains raised writing : BALL ECLIPSE WIDE MOUTH 
Top of jar near mouth has raised writing : WIRE SIDE

Measures approximately 7 1/2"" high with a  3 3/4"" base 
Quart size 

So many possibilities for this beautiful piece ~  add to a collection of canning jars, use as a floral vase for fresh cut flowers or simply make it functional handout in it the bathroom for storage ~  keep your cotton balls or Q tips in it!

NOTE - Jars are intended for display only! Please do not can food in these jars. Canning food in vintage jars may cause jars to shatter and could cause injury or damage.

Grapette was developed by Benjamin ""Tyndle"" Fooks when, while working as a traveling salesman selling a product known as ""Fooks Flavors"", he noticed the popularity of his grape flavor. From this, Fooks, dissatisfied with existing grape sodas on the market, sought to develop a grape soda that tasted the way he believed that a grape soda should taste. Over the course of two years and tens of thousands of taste tests, by 1939, he had developed a flavor that he believed was superior to all other grape sodas available at the time. - Wikipedia

"Vintage Old Metal Street White Black Sign Antique Road Name Sign E SIXTH ST Wall Decor Woods Wall Hanger Industrial Rustic Shabby Chic 1940s","Listing is for one vintage metal street sign hand painted with ""E SIXTH STREET"" in raised black lettering.

Very solid and heavy, beautiful weathered look perfect for your shabby chic decor!!

Measures: 24"" wide by 6"" tall 

 The ends of the sign have a hole for attaching the sign to a wall or board ~ some rusting is noted in this area. The black lettering is distressed and some areas show loss. White background coloring is chalky and leaves some residue on your finger if you run it across the sign, however most of the white on the face of the sign is worn.  Sign is made of heavy metal. d

Solid and strong with a real nice rustic / industrial look and feel ~. You can notice brush strokes on the bottom of the sign and on lettering - the sign appears to have been handprinted and dates from the 1940's.

I have more street signs to be listed....  E First,  E Fourth, W Fifth, Seventh, Eleventh, E Eleventh.

Measures approximately :
56"" wide x 81"" long   

VERY GOOD vintage condition - No stains, rips, tears or holes. NOTE- you can see crude stitching ( brown in coloring) holding the squares together in places ( see photos) ~ this adds to the charm of the vintage piece .... most certainly made by a granny :)  Little to no piling of the yarn is noted. Colors vibrant ~ blanket is of medium weight and has some slight stretch to it, but I am unsure of material content of the yarn.  Edging features a rainbow pattern~  see photos) 
This fantastic piece was from an estate sale of an elderly lady that made this piece in the 50's !  It was reported that this piece adorned the back of her couch since it was made!  

Gorgeous coloring ~ someone put a lot of love into creating this piece ~ you can tell it has been gently loved over the years! 
Perfect for any 1950's 60's 70's decor ! 

Fantastic coloring - perfect sofa throw to give your room  that RETRO look !

"Primitive wooden barn pulley, rustic farm barn wooden pulley, antique farm decor, industrial wood / metal single pulley, industrial salvage","This beauty is straight out of a 100+ year old cow barn that we tore down.  Its worn edges tell the story of MANY bales of hay being lowered from the loft to the cattle below. The groove portion of the wood is smooth. Some cracks can be seen in the wood, but none go all the way through the piece. The metal shows rust and some corrosion ( see photos) 
Piece is  solid and secure - wooden pulley rotates freely on the metal piece

The wooden pulley measures approximately 5 3/4"" in diameter and the metal portion measures approximately 7"" long ( including the top ring).  The diameter of the top ring is 2 1/4"" .

MAKER:  Shawnee Pottery 
PATTERN: Rosette yellow 
CIRCA : 1941 - 

This cheerful OLD yellow pottery tea pot measures 9"" across the top from handle to spout end and stands approximately 6"" tall to the top of the finial.  The coloring is beautiful ! 

It does have  some ""boo boos "" that make it a great display piece ......or could be dressed up with a floral arrangement.  I think it has potential to make a great gift container for someone who is in need of a little sunshine AND loves vintage things!  Imagine some fresh flowers in it or brightly colored tissue paper , a floral styrofoam piece in the bottom and floral sticks holding  gift cards!!!  BAM- INSTANT happiness!!! 

The spout has a chip on the underside ( see photo).  The inside and outside of the pot has visible  crackling of the glaze due to age.   The inside have much larger and darker lines running through the piece. Outside crackling is noticeable as well.  The rest of the pot is free from chipping - it has a nice shine and the yellow coloring is beautiful. 

Bottom of piece is marked USA in indexed letters

FUN FACT:
Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

The inner edge ( located by the handle) shows a small hairline crack - see photo.  On the inside of the piece, there is a portion of the wall where the glaze is crackled and allows water to seep through to the ceramic portion underneath the glaze ( see photo)

"20 pc Vintage fireking Golden Anniversary  wedding table dishes vintage milk glass gold rim bridal registry fireking dishes sweetheart","** Listing cost is for FOUR 5 piece PLACE SETTINGS ~ 20 pieces total  **

~ Fire King's Golden Anniversary - an ivory swirl with heavy gold border. This pattern was produced in the mid fifties to commemorate their 50 years of business. 

Each setting contains 5 pieces 

1 Dinner plate  ~ 9 1/8""
1 Salad plate  ~  7  3/4""
1 berry bowl   ~   4  3/4""
1 saucer        ~   5  3/4""
1 cup     ~   3  3/4 in diameter 

These vintage -opaque white milk glass FIRE KING dishes are in VERY GOOD condition ~ the 22 Kt gold rims show wear consistent for their age ( please look at photos carefully ). 
 Gold edging is not a solid rim of gold, but instead is more of a ""gold spray"" on the rims of the dishes.  There are some variations in coloring if you look closely - some are whiter than others, while some have a yellow hue to them from aging. 
Little surface scratching is noted -
NOTE- the handles on two cups show a crack in the glass that can be caught with your fingernail - this does not go all the way through ( see photos)

(I wouldn't suggest placing them in the dishwasher as that will make the gold fade- these dishes must be hand washed ) 

Bottoms of all pieces are marked : 
OVEN FIREKING ( in script) WARE MADE IN THE USA ( marking dates dishes from 1951 - 1960) 

I also have a set of TWO place settings listed that have EXCELLENT Gold sprays ~ search my shop for Fire king

The beads are strung on a thick thread, not plastic . Five different types of beads make up the pattern on this piece. 
A hook clasp is securely attached to the end of the necklace - the metal shows patina with green residue ( perhaps it is brass??) 

Both are in fantastic vintage condition with no damage of any kind!

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised floral pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

In February 1946, the Stetson China Company purchased the Illinois China Company located in Lincoln, Illinois. Stetson China moved its main base of operations to Lincoln in 1946, but it had been in business for 27 years before that, mainly based in Chicago. Lincoln plant produced pottery from 1946- 1966. 

Individual items were painted systematically.  Instructors trained women in painting a particular image.  Then, each painter ""sat at a table, picking up a plate from a moving belt, painting her part, then putting it back on the belt.  She was paid a salary and also by the piece"" .  Some women would paint individual leaves or clusters of them; some might paint just dots; and more advanced painters did whole flowers.

"4 Vintage Pressed Glass Water Goblets, Mid Century pedestal goblets Hazel Atlas Gothic ice tea/ water glasses, wedding table, 1950's glasses","FOUR (4)  Vintage Hazel Atlas Glass Co Pressed Glass Gothic Footed Glass Tumblers ~ great for mismatch wedding table place settings! 

2 sets of FOUR available plus one single goblet~ plus 4 slightly cloudy goblets that are available at a discounted rate

This is a GREAT set of vintage  glass goblets from the 1950s ~  manufactured by Hazel Atlas in the Gothic pattern.   Each pressed glass is decorated with a diamond and fan motif on the sides of the goblet and stem. Bottoms have a starburst motif.

This glassware was used by Big Top as a promotional item to package  their peanut butter. Glasses were  sold with a metal lid and filled with peanut butter .  Mid century housewives  were eager to buy the peanut butter to collect glasses for their tables.  Hazel Atlas also sold the glasses, cups, saucers, and plates separately under the name of Gothic glassware. 

Measurements - approximately 5 1/2 "" tall with a 2.5"" diameter and footed base 
Holds approximately 10 ounces 

All goblets are in VERY GOOD vintage condition with no chips or cracks noted. 
Rims are smooth to the touch. Most glasses have little to no clouding/ scaling on the inside of the glass - this is noted when the glasses are held up to light.  As I fill orders, the glasses that are in the best condition will be sold first.  Some glasses have a haziness to the inside. Yellowing of the glass from age is noted on a few of the glasses as well as some slight surface scratching 

This is a great set to use for catering, entertaining guests, wedding showers, wedding toasting , bridal showers , and much much more!

Measures approximately: 76"" long x 54"" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. It is a thicker yarn, so the blanket is medium weight

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage!  Light piling of the yarn is noted mainly near the edges There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see photos)  along wth some not so perfect stitches.  Lovely piece with retro 1970 colors ~ perfect for any RETRO decor !

"Vintage 70s hand crocheted wool afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Black orange yellow Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","Beautifully crafted vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a stripped chevron / zig zag pattern! 

Note the size of this piece ~ 
Measures approximately : 44 "" long x 32"" wide - material is somewhat stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix, but there appears to be some kind of a wool blend as well. 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Little to no piling of the yarn. There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see photos)  along wth some not so perfect stitches.  Lovely piece with retro 1970 colors ~ perfect for any RETRO decor ! 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

Taken from the blog above : 
The history behind this unique style of dishware is a great American story about a once thriving pottery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Tennessee.  Although our current inventory of Blue Ridge is limited, our appreciation at Southern Vintage Table for this American-made china is growing!
The story begins in the early 1900s when a railroad company sold a large parcel of land along their railroad line in Erwin, Tennessee to a group of investors. There were rich deposits of kaolinite and feldspar nearby, perfect ingredients for a pottery business. According to Wikipedia, in 1916 Clinchfield Potteries opened their doors for business, manufacturing the typical china style of the times which were described as “gold-trimmed, decal-decorated dishes”.
In the 1920s the business was sold and became known as Southern Potteries. To set his style of china apart from his competitors, the new owner introduced a hand painted, underglaze technique. The bold, new patterns, painted by the local women, were stamped with the new label, Blue Ridge, sometime during the 1930s.
