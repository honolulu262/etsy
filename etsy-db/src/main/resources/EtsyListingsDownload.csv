Positively pretty in  PINK!!!  

Libbey Premiere Pattern Plum White Wine Glasses made in the USA of light plum colored glass. 
** 17 sets of 4 available - also available: single glass purchasing option  **

Each is approximately 7 1/4-inches tall overall with the bowl of the goblet being 4-inches deep and 2-inches in diameter at the rim. 

 Made of heavy glass - not thin and delicate.  Glasses  holds 8-oz of the beverage of your choice !

Bottoms of the glasses are marked with the  Libbey mark (script ""L"") in a circle - glasses have a nice ring to them when you flick them with your finger !

ALL glasses are in VERY GOOD  vintage condition with no cracks  or chips and the plum color is wonderful. Rims are smooth to the touch. Glass is shiny with no cloudiness - there are some random water marks on a few glasses - they are in need of  a good soak- since they have been gently use- there maybe some very slight surface scratches that can be seen if held to the direct light. I have not noticed this on these gorgeous glasses, but want to make sure the buyer understands that these glasses are vintage and have been gently used :)

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Greens Beige Tan Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor 1970s","Beautifully crafted Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with fantastic coloring ~ Kelly green, light beige/ off white and army green!

Measures approximately: 71"" long x 50"" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. Blanket has some weight to it. 

GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or holes. Piling of the yarn is noted in places and the blanket edges are not entirely straight - with some stray yarn ends occasionally peeking out.

"Mid Century Crocheted blanket Vintage afghan Granny Square multicolored afghan Handmade patchwork Sofa Throw 1950's 60's 70's decor BOHO","Mid Century Crocheted blanket, Vintage multicolored afghan, Handmade black / multicolored geometric patchwork Granny Square Sofa Throw, 1950's 60's 70's decor 

Measures approximately:  48"" wide x 58"" long   

VERY GOOD vintage condition - No staining or tears.  Light piling of the yarn noted in areas - could be the differences in yarn quality. Colors are vibrant ~ blanket is medium weight making it a nice lap blanket.

NOTE -  One area has an opening that is noted between the squares where they are stitched together. This could be repaired easily with a quick stitch. I will leave that to the new owner.
NOTE- the afghan backside does not look as finished as the front side as some  of the stitches are finished on the back resulting in stray pieces of yarn that are noted sticking up. 

Most of the squares are a solid color but a few are a mixed batch of coloring ~ note the photos 

Some stray hairs are noted on the piece - not sure if they are human or animal. Piece has been laundered and air dried. 

Unsure of material used - blanket has some stretch to it as well as
gorgeous coloring ~ someone put a lot of love into creating this piece ~ you can tell it has been gently loved over the years! 

Perfect for any 1950's 60's 70's decor ! 

Fantastic coloring - perfect sofa throw to give your room  that RETRO look !

This beautiful bowl measures: 8 1/8 "" wide at the top x  4 1/2"" tall x deep

Condition : 
Bowl has been gently used & is in good  vintage condition. 
NOTE- there is a hairline crack on the inside bottom of the bowl - this does not go through to the outer portion of the bowl and is faintly visible unless the piece is filled with water.  Because of this, I would not use the bowl for serving food, but use it for display purposes.  (See last two photos - coloring is not accurate in the last photo - I used a flash to capture the hairline crack) 

No chips or heavy cracking - glaze is intact and free from crackling.  Bowl rim is free from chipping - there is a tiny fleabites chip noted on the edge of rim - see photos .  Some swirls and inconsistencies are noted in the glaze pattern from manufacturing. 
   
Bottom has a piece of tape that proudly displays the former owners name. Under the tape the bowl is marked Knowles pottery 

Nice addition for your country farmhouse ~ Great fruit bowl to set on the counter or to add a pop of color to your cabinets !

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company. The company was purchased by Interpace and produced a line of glassware (Madeira) to complement the Franciscan dinnerware patterns. The final end came to the company in 1980 when production ceased.

History : 
 Cathrineholm of Norway is responsible for the simple and attractive enamelware that was a staple in households across Scandinavia and America in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Their iconic lotus pattern is their most recognizable, and a classic of mid-century modern design. The designer responsible for this striking collection was a woman by the name of Grete Prytz Kittelsen. Kittelsen, often referred to as the “Queen of Scandinavian Design,” was known for her beautiful work with sterling, enamel, and other metals. Her designs earned her numerous awards, as well as well-deserved attention as an inspiration and integral part of the Scandinavian Design movement.

Beautiful Antique blue and white transfer ware divided grill plate with 3 large areas & 2 small round indentions on either side of the plate ( maybe for thumb placement when carrying the plate?) 

Measures: 11 1/4"" in diameter 

All pieces show crackling of the glaze which is consistent with their age - note all photos.  Not sure if the glaze is broken so that water will soak through when plates are immersed in water. Plates are free from chipping and rough edges, no cracking. Plate edges have a few dark marks that are pin point sized - see photos of plate edges . These is some slight scuffing from plates being stacked.

"Vintage John B Taylor Ceramics Harvest Cup / Saucer, Hand painted Pear Grapes Figs stoneware mugs, Vintage Louisville Pottery stoneware cups","SOLD INDIVIDUALLY 
**7 available **

I also have two single cups ` message me if you are interested

MAKER: John B Taylor Ceramics / Louisville Stoneware
PATTERN:  Harvest 
Circa 1954
Discontinued 

Pieces are all signed - different stampings are noted on cups and saucers identifying some pieces as older than others. ( see photos) . Most are marked John B Taylor Ceramics, a few are marked with JBT initials only 

Measurements: 
Cups 3 1/4""tall x 3 3/8"" diameter at opening 
Saucer 6 3/8"" in diameter x 1"""" tall 

GOOD vintage condition -  These pieces have been used gently and show age appropriate wear.  Glaze appears intact on all pieces and has a nice shine.  Hand painted designs have fantastic coloring and each piece shows some slight variance in coloring or pattern design.
Inside of cups show scuffing and surface scratching from spoon stirring. One mug has a small raised black pin point mark on the inside bottom- this seems to be from manufacturing.  

**NOTE- one saucer ( bears the oldest mark) has a nice size chip on the underside of edge &   One cup shows a tiny knick on the rim (appears to be from manufacturing). 
This set will be sold last.

I will try to match cups with saucers that are marked similarly, but  can not guarantee that the markings will be the same on each cup/ saucer pair. All of the cups, except one , are marked with the stamp: John Taylor Ceramics.
 
**If you are a resident of Alaska OR Hawaii- please contact me PRIOR to purchase to get an accurate shipping amount for your location as the listed shipping does not include your areas. 

If you are interested in more than one cup set- please message me your zip code and I can get an accurate shipping amount for you!

FOUR (4) Vintage Franciscan Madeira TIFFIN  PLUM  footed juice goblets

Discontinued glass 
Circa - 1972 - 1976

Made of heavy glass  ~ in EXCELLENT vintage condition- I would almost say MINT!* One glass appears to have a hairline crack on the inside of the bowl at the bottom. It does not go through to the outside of the glass because of the thickness of the glass. See last photo .

They appear to have had little to no use - Great shine on the inside of glasses - no scratching , chips, cracks or cloudiness , rims are smooth to the touch. 

Stands approximately 4 7/8"" tall with a 3"" diameter -  They are not all the exact same height ( see last photos) 
Holds approximately 6 ounces when filled to the rim! 

Beautiful PURPLE  coloring on these retro beauties :)

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company. The company was purchased by Interpace and produced a line of glassware (Madeira) to complement the Franciscan dinnerware patterns. The final end came to the company in 1980 when production ceased.

The metal screw caps shows some denting ~ but each lid fits solidly on the shaker- it is not stripped. The black & silver sticker with the lettering that says SALT / PEPPER is in EXCELLENT condition.  Inside rim of the pieces are free from chips or cracks.  The pepper shaker has a straw line on the back from manufacture - this is not a crack, but a line in the glass ( see last photo) 
Bottoms are different on each shaker ( see photos) 

No makers markings noted ~ appears to be made of Milk Glass Vitrock ~ This is opaque, solid white. 

Measurements 
*NOTE - the salt shaker is slightly taller than the pepper ( see photos and measurements) 

~ SALT  5""  tall ( with lid)  
~ PEPPER 4 3/4"" tall ( with lid)

"X Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Navy and Gold yellow Cable Retro sofa throw blanket Mid Century Lodge decor retro afghan","Beautifully crafted XLarge vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with fantastic coloring ~  Navy Blue and Gold / Yellow 

Measures approximately: 98"" long x 72 "" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. Blanket has a heavy weight and large! 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears, holes, odors or damage !  Piling of the yarn is noted as well as some stray hairs ( not sure if these are from a pet or human... in case you are allergic)   ~ great coloring .... perfect for that Notre Dame fan! !

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

~ VERY GOOD vintage condition with no chips or cracks. Rims are smooth to the touch ~ Great shine - no clouding. There maybe some slight surface scratches that can be seen when glasses are held to the direct light. Some of the glasses show some light clouding / scaling that can be seen when the glasses are held up to the light. These are gently used vintage items and thus will show some level of wear. 

These are not intended for the dishwasher...or to soak in bleach water...... this will take off the gold trim... ...….
just a fyi~ if you want the glasses to all look the same.. you know what to do…. also a MR CLEAN sponge will take the gold right off as well. This makes the glasses look uniform, as long as you aren't interested in the gold rims!  :) 

Some glasses are marked with cursive L in circle & some have no markings on these glasses to identify the maker,

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled arcs knitted blanket Brown Cream Rust Retro sofa throw Mid Century Lodge decor","~ LARGE Vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled arcs in Shades of Brown Cream and Rust  Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor ~

Beautifully crafted LARGE vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a stripped arcs pattern! 

Measures approximately : 74"" long x 52"" wide with an additional  3.5"" fringe - material is somewhat stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight.  This would make a nice lap blanket ~ or a throw for a pop of colors 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix.

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Some piling of the yarn is noted on the blanket. There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see last photo) . 
This piece has been laundered and air dried.

Very solid and heavy, beautiful weathered look perfect for your shabby chic decor!!

Measures: 24"" wide by 6"" tall 

The ends of the sign have a hole for attaching the sign to a wall or board ~ some rusting is noted in this area. The black lettering is distressed and some areas show loss. White background coloring is chalky and leaves some residue on your finger if you run it across the sign, however most of the white on the face of the sign is worn.  Sign is made of heavy metal. 

Solid and strong with a real nice rustic / industrial look and feel ~. You can notice brush strokes on the bottom of the sign and on lettering - the sign appears to have been handprinted and dates from the 1940's.

VERY GOOD vintage condition  ~Bowl shows normal wear and tear from years of use. No cracking noted - Glaze is worn on the bowl rim showing the raw stoneware .  No chipping is noted on the rim, however, one area that presents as a chip on the inside of the rim - but this is likely from manufacturing as the glaze is smooth and not rough as it would be with a chip. This flaw has been there for a while as it is smooth and discolored like the rim. SEE PHOTOS   Some small pin holes are noted in the glaze on the outer surface - these are consistent with manufacturing of the pieces during this era.
 
Beautiful grey / beige coloring - perfect for any farmhouse decor . 

The bowl is 10 3/4"" wide, and stands  4 5/8 "" tall
Band rim measures 1 1/2"" wide

 GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage ! Slight piling of the yarn is noted - no fading  ~. NOTE - there is one edge that has some stitching that came loose making it look like a bit was taken out of the edge ( see last photo).

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Red Pink Retro sofa throw blanket Mid Century Lodge decor Grandmas house","Beautifully crafted Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan / blanket with a stripped chevron / zig zag pattern ! 

Gorgeous colors two shades of pink and one red

Measures approximately 74"" long x 46"" wide - material has stretch to it .  Above measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix as there is some stretch to the yarn. 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no tears or rippling.  Piling of the yarn is noted with visible fuzzing. Edges are damage free - no holes.   Stray pieces of yarn are noted on the underside of the blanket where the stitches were tied off.  These can be trimmed down - they are secure however and will not unravel. 
NOTE- one small stain is noted on the light pink portion - this is faint but there none the less. See last photo - this was taken before it was laundered.  

This piece has been laundered and air dried and is odor free!

Grapette was developed by Benjamin ""Tyndle"" Fooks when, while working as a traveling salesman selling a product known as ""Fooks Flavors"", he noticed the popularity of his grape flavor. From this, Fooks, dissatisfied with existing grape sodas on the market, sought to develop a grape soda that tasted the way he believed that a grape soda should taste. Over the course of two years and tens of thousands of taste tests, by 1939, he had developed a flavor that he believed was superior to all other grape sodas available at the time. - Wikipedia

"AUTHENTIC Vintage Old Metal Street White Black Sign Antique Road Name Sign E SIXTH ST Wall Decor Wall Hanger Industrial Rustic Shabby 1940","Listing is for one vintage metal street sign hand painted with ""E SIXTH STREET"" in raised black lettering ~ not a reproduction !  This is the real deal :) 

Very solid and heavy, beautiful weathered look perfect for your shabby chic decor!!

Measures: 24"" wide by 6"" tall 

 The ends of the sign have a hole for attaching the sign to a wall or board ~ some rusting is noted in this area. The black lettering is distressed and some areas show loss. White background coloring is chalky and leaves some residue on your finger if you run it across the sign, however most of the white on the face of the sign is worn.  Sign is made of heavy metal. d

Solid and strong with a real nice rustic / industrial look and feel ~. You can notice brush strokes on the bottom of the sign and on lettering - the sign appears to have been handprinted and dates from the 1940's.

I have more street signs to be listed....  E First,  E Fourth, W Fifth, Seventh, Eleventh, E Eleventh.

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket, Striped Shade of Blue afghan Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor farmhouse","Beautifully crafted Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a striped pattern of 5 shades of blue

Measures approximately: 60 "" long x 49"" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix.

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Little to no piling of the yarn. 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

"vintage Shawnee yellow Rosette tea pot w/ lid old yellow tea pot, farmhouse shabby decor, vintage yellow pottery, floral flower display","Doesn't this color of yellow just make you want to smile? :) 

MAKER:  Shawnee Pottery 
PATTERN: Rosette yellow 
CIRCA : 1941 - 

This cheerful OLD yellow pottery tea pot measures 9"" across the top from handle to spout end and stands approximately 6"" tall to the top of the finial.  The coloring is beautiful ! 

It does have  some ""boo boos "" that make it a great display piece ......or could be dressed up with a floral arrangement.  I think it has potential to make a great gift container for someone who is in need of a little sunshine AND loves vintage things!  Imagine some fresh flowers in it or brightly colored tissue paper , a floral styrofoam piece in the bottom and floral sticks holding  gift cards!!!  BAM- INSTANT happiness!!! 

The spout has a chip on the underside ( see photo).  The inside and outside of the pot has visible  crackling of the glaze due to age.   The inside have much larger and darker lines running through the piece. Outside crackling is noticeable as well.  The rest of the pot is free from chipping - it has a nice shine and the yellow coloring is beautiful. 

Bottom of piece is marked USA in indexed letters

Measures approximately: 80"" long x 54"" wide - material has some slight stretch to it!  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight.  This would make a nice lap blanket ~ or a throw for a pop of colors.

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. Stitching is tight and blanket is of heavy weight 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Light piling of the yarn is noted in some places on the blanket. Some random stray hairs maybe noted on the blanket from the previous owner. 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

Measures :  8 "" x 8 "" octagon

All in VERY GOOD vintage condition - No chips, cracks, or deep scratching.  As with all vintage items, some slight surface scratches can be seen on the tops of the plates from utensil use and some on the bottom from stacking . Plates have a nice shine and edges are free from knicking and rough spots. Tiny air bubbles can be seen in some of the plates. 

Coloring is a pale pink…… I have used a white plate behind them so that you can see the coloring.  This set would make a wonderful table setting for a bridal shower or sweetheart table!  Last photo shows how it can be layered with other plates! 

Unsure of the maker and exact date of manufacture - plates appear similar to Heisey Flamingo or Cambridge

"2 silver band rim Roly Poly glasses with construction equipment Mid Century bar cart glasses MCM cocktail glass Mad Men style 1960's barware","Listing cost is for TWO vintage rounded Silver Band Roly Poly glasses with a construction / excavating design perfect for MCM bar cart serving ! 

The silver bands have raised construction/ excavation designs encircling the glass - this was hard to photograph. These are unsigned pieces so I am unsure of the maker or date of manufacture.

Silver band on the inside and out side show light wear ( one glass more than the other) - since this is a vintage item they are not mint - if you hold the glasses up to direct light you will see areas of loss of coloring on the silver on these glasses. 

The glass portion of all pieces is in VERY GOOD vintage condition with minimal scratching - they have a great shine - no cloudiness to them - rims are smooth to the touch - no chips, cracks or knicks !

Glasses measure approximately 3 1/4"" tall and approximately 3 1/8"" in diameter   
Silver band is approximately 3/4"" thick
Holds 10 oz.

FUN FACT:
Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

"20 pc Vintage fireking Golden Anniversary  wedding table dishes vintage milk glass gold rim bridal registry fireking dishes sweetheart","** Listing cost is for FOUR 5 piece PLACE SETTINGS ~ 20 pieces total  **

~ Fire King's Golden Anniversary - an ivory swirl with heavy gold border. This pattern was produced in the mid fifties to commemorate their 50 years of business. 

Each setting contains 5 pieces 

1 Dinner plate  ~ 9 1/8""
1 Salad plate  ~  7  3/4""
1 berry bowl   ~   4  3/4""
1 saucer        ~   5  3/4""
1 cup     ~   3  3/4 in diameter 

These vintage -opaque white milk glass FIRE KING dishes are in VERY GOOD condition ~ the 22 Kt gold rims show wear consistent for their age ( please look at photos carefully ). 
 Gold edging is not a solid rim of gold, but instead is more of a ""gold spray"" on the rims of the dishes.  There are some variations in coloring if you look closely - some are whiter than others, while some have a yellow hue to them from aging. 
Little surface scratching is noted -
NOTE- the handles on two cups show a crack in the glass that can be caught with your fingernail - this does not go all the way through ( see photos)

(I wouldn't suggest placing them in the dishwasher as that will make the gold fade- these dishes must be hand washed ) 

Bottoms of all pieces are marked : 
OVEN FIREKING ( in script) WARE MADE IN THE USA ( marking dates dishes from 1951 - 1960)

Great pieces to use for display or add to an existing collection !

FUN FACT : 
Louis B. Stetson, opened the Stetson China Company in 1919 in Chicago. Louis' nephew Joseph W. Stetson joined the firm during its first year. Joe was 21 years old when he joined Stetson China. In February 1946, the Stetson China Company purchased the Illinois China Company located in Lincoln, Illinois. Stetson China moved its main base of operations to Lincoln in 1946, but it had been in business for 27 years before that, mainly based in Chicago. Lincoln plant produced pottery from 1946- 1966. 

Individual items were painted systematically.  Instructors trained women in painting a particular image.  Then, each painter ""sat at a table, picking up a plate from a moving belt, painting her part, then putting it back on the belt.  She was paid a salary and also by the piece"" .  Some women would paint individual leaves or clusters of them; some might paint just dots; and more advanced painters did whole flowers.

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised floral pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

Goblets measure approximately:  5 3/4 "" tall with a  3 1/4"" diameter  
Holds approximately 8 ounces 

Unsure of the maker…. there are no markings to identity the manufacture date or manufacturer, but they appear to be made by the Fenton Art Glass Company of Williamstown, West Virginia during the years 1950-1965 
                                                                 
EXCELLENT vintage condition - no chips, cracking or discoloration of glass - rims are smooth to the touch.  Hob nails show no wear or rough spots. Glass is heavy and a solid clean white coloring, not opaque. One goblet has a small "" yellow"" spot on the base - this will be sold last. See last photo 

Side of goblets feature smooth bumpy knobs  and the stem is the same pattern but spiraled upward. Base is smooth and the underside is not flush with the surface, it rounds up in the center slightly. 

Great pieces for display or to add to your collection!

~Measures: 9 1/8"" in diameter x 4 1/4"" tall 

~VERY GOOD vintage condition - The rim of the bowl & interior of bowl displays several pin holes in the glaze. The inside of the bowl shows utensil markings from years of beaters scraping the bowl, the glaze shows no crackling. One area on the outside rim shows an area where the gaze did not stick ( see photos) - this appears to look like a chip.   The pastel coloring is great for spring decorating or to add to your existing antique bowl collection.

This vintage reed / wicker basket is the perfect size to hold napkins & paper plates!  Whether you are serving friends on your deck or at a picnic, this basket is sure to be a hit!

6 1/2"" X 9 3/4"" - wide 
11"" tall  (including the handle) 
5 1/4"" tall  (without the handle ~ basket portion ) 
5"" deep 

VERY GOOD vintage condition - no breaks, stains or odors :)  The top of handle has a small area or breakage where the reed looping is missing a wrap - this area is not loose with reeds sticking out ( see photo) Some dust has settled in the weaving from storage.  

I'm thinking it could also be used as a marker/ craft  caddy for kiddos !!
Add a ribbon to dress it up and use it for a wedding card basket !

Here's a tidbit about this pottery : 
Frankoma Pottery was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma 1933. John Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year.[3] The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma.

Individual items were painted systematically.  Instructors trained women in painting a particular image.  Then, each painter ""sat at a table, picking up a plate from a moving belt, painting her part, then putting it back on the belt.  She was paid a salary and also by the piece"" .  Some women would paint individual leaves or clusters of them; some might paint just dots; and more advanced painters did whole flowers.

"4 Vintage Pressed Glass Water Goblets, Mid Century pedestal goblets Hazel Atlas Gothic ice tea/ water glasses, wedding table, 1950's glasses","FOUR (4)  Vintage Hazel Atlas Glass Co Pressed Glass Gothic Footed Glass Tumblers ~ great for mismatch wedding table place settings! 

7 sets of FOUR available

This is a GREAT set of vintage  glass goblets from the 1950s ~  manufactured by Hazel Atlas in the Gothic pattern.   Each pressed glass is decorated with a diamond and fan motif on the sides of the goblet and stem. Bottoms have a starburst motif.

This glassware was used by Big Top as a promotional item to package  their peanut butter. Glasses were  sold with a metal lid and filled with peanut butter .  Mid century housewives  were eager to buy the peanut butter to collect glasses for their tables.  Hazel Atlas also sold the glasses, cups, saucers, and plates separately under the name of Gothic glassware. 

Measurements - approximately 5 3/4"" tall with a 3"" diameter and footed base 
Holds approximately 10 ounces 

All goblets are in VERY GOOD vintage condition with no chips or cracks noted. 
Rims are smooth to the touch. Most glasses have little to no clouding/ scaling on the inside of the glass - this is noted when the glasses are held up to light.  As I fill orders, the glasses that are in the best condition will be sold first.  Some glasses have a haziness to the inside. Yellowing of the glass from age is noted on a few of the glasses as well as some slight surface scratching 

This is a great set to use for catering, entertaining guests, wedding showers, wedding toasting , bridal showers , and much much more!

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Brown Beige Red green Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","This RETRO piece comes from a friend's collection ~ it has been stored lovingly and cared for gently!   Beautifully crafted Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a stripped chevron / zig zag pattern! 

Measures approximately: 76"" long x 54"" wide - material is stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. It is a thicker yarn, so the blanket is medium weight

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage!  Light piling of the yarn is noted mainly near the edges There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see photos)  along wth some not so perfect stitches.  Lovely piece with retro 1970 colors ~ perfect for any RETRO decor ! 

This piece has been laundered and air dried.

Cork stoppers fit securely into the top and are not discolored or damaged. The silver caps on top of the cork shows very slight denting on a few of the pieces.  Glass is clear and free from discoloration or damage! Handle is securely attached to the carafe and these are ready for use! 

Measures approximately 5"" Tall

"Vintage 70s hand crocheted wool afghan blanket Rippled Chevron Black orange yellow Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","Beautifully crafted vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a stripped chevron / zig zag pattern! 

Note the size of this piece ~ 
Measures approximately : 44 "" long x 32"" wide - material is somewhat stretchy !  These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix, but there appears to be some kind of a wool blend as well. 

VERY GOOD preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Little to no piling of the yarn. There are some edges that have a ""less than perfect "" finish ( see photos)  along wth some not so perfect stitches.  Lovely piece with retro 1970 colors ~ perfect for any RETRO decor !

The goblets have a lovely TING when you ping them!! 

Great wedding gift :)

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company. The company was purchased by Interpace and produced a line of glassware (Madeira) to complement the Franciscan dinnerware patterns. The final end came to the company in 1980 when production ceased.

Blog : 
http://southernvintagetable.wordpress.com/2014/02/02/vintage-feature-the-magic-behind-vintage-blue-ridge-china/


Taken from the blog above : 
The history behind this unique style of dishware is a great American story about a once thriving pottery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Tennessee.  Although our current inventory of Blue Ridge is limited, our appreciation at Southern Vintage Table for this American-made china is growing!
The story begins in the early 1900s when a railroad company sold a large parcel of land along their railroad line in Erwin, Tennessee to a group of investors. There were rich deposits of kaolinite and feldspar nearby, perfect ingredients for a pottery business. According to Wikipedia, in 1916 Clinchfield Potteries opened their doors for business, manufacturing the typical china style of the times which were described as “gold-trimmed, decal-decorated dishes”.
In the 1920s the business was sold and became known as Southern Potteries. To set his style of china apart from his competitors, the new owner introduced a hand painted, underglaze technique. The bold, new patterns, painted by the local women, were stamped with the new label, Blue Ridge, sometime during the 1930s.

Here's a tidbit about this pottery : 
Frankoma Pottery was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma 1933. John Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year.[3] The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma.

Cute vintage soup bowls with under  plates attached OR gravy boats, not sure which!!!  I think they would make cute individual soup bowls for a luncheon!!  The attached under plate is the perfect place to set crackers or a baguette. 

GOOD vintage condition - Glaze is intact on all of these pieces, however, there are a few minor dings on each other these pieces ~ see all photos .  One has a small nick on the handle, one has a small chip on the underside of the plate, one has some dark discoloration in the bowl bottom and two have some discoloration on then handles where there is a small nick and the glaze has been compromised.

Each side of the afghan measures 34"" and it measures 56"" from side to side and 66"" from diagonal point to diagonal point. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. The afghan is of light weight material.  

GOOD  preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage !  Slight piling of the yarn is noted ( see photos)  along with some random pieces of yarn sticking out.

FUN FACT : 
Louis B. Stetson, opened the Stetson China Company in 1919 in Chicago. Louis' nephew Joseph W. Stetson joined the firm during its first year. Joe was 21 years old when he joined Stetson China. In February 1946, the Stetson China Company purchased the Illinois China Company located in Lincoln, Illinois. Stetson China moved its main base of operations to Lincoln in 1946, but it had been in business for 27 years before that, mainly based in Chicago.

Inner surface of the bowl has an area the the glaze did not adhere to the pottery portion of the bowl. This is on the bottom of the bowl ( see photos). This makes this bowl more of a display piece rather than a functional bowl for food use.

FUN FACT : 
Louis B. Stetson, opened the Stetson China Company in 1919 in Chicago. Louis' nephew Joseph W. Stetson joined the firm during its first year. Joe was 21 years old when he joined Stetson China. In February 1946, the Stetson China Company purchased the Illinois China Company located in Lincoln, Illinois. Stetson China moved its main base of operations to Lincoln in 1946, but it had been in business for 27 years before that, mainly based in Chicago. Lincoln plant produced pottery from 1946- 1966. 

Individual items were painted systematically.  Instructors trained women in painting a particular image.  Then, each painter ""sat at a table, picking up a plate from a moving belt, painting her part, then putting it back on the belt.  She was paid a salary and also by the piece"" .  Some women would paint individual leaves or clusters of them; some might paint just dots; and more advanced painters did whole flowers.

In 1983, Fostoria closed its doors, but the Fostoria brand remains highly collectible as a legendary American icon.

I don't claim to be an expert in the area of sewing at all....the extent of my knowledge was making a pair of pants in 4 H with 1970's fabric~ so I applaud those of you who are talented in this area!! 

This piece of fabric is great for those who love to sew vintage clothing OR to use with up- cycled projects !  Fabric HAS not been laundered, but is clean, stain free, hole -free  and SMOKE FREE!  Side edges are straight, ends have not been cut exactly straight, but close ( see pic) . The side edges appear to have been stitched together  and then the stitches removed as there are stitching holes along the sides ( see photo) , but again,... my sewing knowledge is limited so it could be from something else!   Backside of the fabric is a solid beige/tan - front is a houndstooth pattern in the same coloring  . 

Coloring ~  Beige

Pattern~  Houndstooth 

Width ~  65"" 

Length  ~ 124"" long

Measures approximately:  60"" long x 52"" wide at the top of the afghan .... and 70 "" wide towards the bottom  
This piece is not exactly square with straight edges. It appears that the top portion of the blanket is narrower than the bottom.  Im guessing that when it was being made they lost count and added more stitches at the bottom!  Never the less, it is a great afghan for tossing on the couch or to use as a lap blanket! 
Center of blanket has a white square ( see last photo) 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content.  Afghan is heavy, not lightweight! 

VERY GOOD preowned condition  - no stains, tears or damage !  Only very slight piling of the yarn is noted.  This piece has been laundered and washed up nicely!

VERY GOOD vintage condition: no chipping or crazing or crackling. Glaze is bright and shiny- rim is smooth - the outer portion of the bowl has a few some pin point indentions in the bowl- from manufacturing of this time era . There is one area near the rim where the glaze did not adhere to the pottery - this appears as a chip, but it is not. 

This bowl is in great shape considering its age ! 

Bottom has a faint indention - but can't make out what it says - appears to be an M - guessing it is a McCoy 

The bowl is  8 1/2 "" wide, and stands 4"" tall

Nice addition for your country farmhouse ~ I love using these bowls to serve cut up fruit or pasta salad in!

"Antique Neoclassical Three Face Covered Clear and Frosted Glass Candy Dish Compote LG Wright, collectible glass pedestal bowl with lid","Vintage clear and frosted glass Three Face covered compote candy dish is also known as Three Fates, Three Graces and Three Sisters. 

This design was introduced by John Ernest Miller, mold-shop superintendent for George Duncan and Sons in Pittsburgh, PA, and is rumored to be a likeness of his wife Elizabeth. The design was patented in June of 1878 and was originally called pattern No. 400. L. G. Wright Glass Company produced copies of the design in the late 1960’s. 

Ladies features, hair and jewelry are detailed and crisp. The stem and base of the piece are acid finished giving them a frosted appearance and a satiny feel. The lid and bowl are clear glass.

VERY GOOD vintage condition with no chips or cracking. Faces show no rough spots or nicking. 

The compote measures 6 1/4” in diameter and is 4 1/2” tall without the lid. With the lid in place, the piece measures approximately 8 1/2” tall. The diameter of the base is approximately 3 3/4”.

Taken from the blog above : 
The history behind this unique style of dishware is a great American story about a once thriving pottery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Tennessee.  Although our current inventory of Blue Ridge is limited, our appreciation at Southern Vintage Table for this American-made china is growing!
The story begins in the early 1900s when a railroad company sold a large parcel of land along their railroad line in Erwin, Tennessee to a group of investors. There were rich deposits of kaolinite and feldspar nearby, perfect ingredients for a pottery business. According to Wikipedia, in 1916 Clinchfield Potteries opened their doors for business, manufacturing the typical china style of the times which were described as “gold-trimmed, decal-decorated dishes”.
In the 1920s the business was sold and became known as Southern Potteries. To set his style of china apart from his competitors, the new owner introduced a hand painted, underglaze technique. The bold, new patterns, painted by the local women, were stamped with the new label, Blue Ridge, sometime during the 1930s.

Measures approximately: 70"" long x 48"" wide

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content ~ it has some stretch to it and is heavy weight.  Stitches are close together ~ I believe this is knitted, but I am not entirely sure.  My crafting skills are not honed into the different between crocheting and knitting ! 

Slight piling ( wear) of the yarn is noted.  
Edges are not perfectly straight - this is a sure sign of a hand made piece :)

This piece has been laundered and washed up nicely with no odors, stains, loose stitches or tears!

Marking dates 1958 - 63 

Gorgeous Hand Painted Earthenware with a raised pink rose pattern!

Desert Rose, by Franciscan Dinnerware  is one of the largest-selling casual tableware patterns in the history of dinnerware. Mary Jane Winans, a Franciscan artist, designed and sculpted the Desert Rose pattern. The light pinks and greens of this pattern’s earthenware body perfectly accent the scalloped vine and rose border.  The Desert Rose pattern was introduced in 1941, and during the ensuing decades over 100 different piece types were produced. Franciscan Desert Rose was produced in the US from 1941-1984, in England from 1985-2003, and in China and Thailand since 2004. There is a variance in color between these time periods.

"Vintage fireking Golden Anniversary dish set, wedding table dishes, vintage milk glass w/ gold rim, bridal registry, vintage fireking dishes","** PRICE IS FOR TWO - 5 piece PLACE SETTINGS  **

~ Fire King's Golden Anniversary - an ivory swirl with heavy gold border. This pattern was produced in the mid fifties to commemorate their 50 years of business. 

Each setting contains 5 pieces 

1 Dinner plate  ~ 9 1/8""
1 Salad plate  ~  7  3/4""
1 berry bowl   ~   4  3/4""
1 saucer        ~   5  3/4""
1 cup     ~   3  3/4 in diameter 

These vintage -opaque white -milk glass FIRE KING dishes are in VERY GOOD/ EXCELLENT condition ~ they show very little wear for their age-  22 Kt gold rim is beautiful and shows minimal fading - salad plates show more wear than others.  Gold edging is not a solid rim of gold, but instead is more of a ""gold spray"" on the rims of the dishes.  I have seen many other pieces similar to these , but usually the gold is faded and worn. These pieces have no chips or cracking.  There are some variations in coloring if you look closely - some are whiter than others, while some have a yellow hue to them from aging. NOTE - Gold on some salad plates show slight wear compared to the gold trim on the other pieces. 

(I wouldn't suggest placing them in the dishwasher as that will make the gold fade- these dishes must be hand washed ) 

Bottoms of all pieces are marked : 
OVEN FIREKING ( in script) WARE MADE IN THE USA ( marking dates dishes from 1951 - 1960) 

** Alaska and Hawaii residents please convo me for an accurate shipping amount prior to purchasing - this shipping rate does not apply to your areas

I also have a set of 4 place settings available - these show more gold wear.

* 3 pitchers available * 

ALL pitchers are in GOOD vintage condition with no clouding or cracking. 
NOTE - one pitcher has a small chip on the curved portion of the lip on the inside edge ( see photo) - this does not effect the use of the ice lip or pouring.  This pitcher will be sold last.
2 pitchers are in EXCELLENT vintage condition - no chips or damage 

These pitchers have the classic mid century look and are made of heavy glass.... no dainty pitcher here! 

Pitcher Measures :

*4 sets of 4 available - plus 3 single glasses *

Measures 6.5"" tall with a  2  3/4"" diameter
Holds  10 - 11 ounces 

These vintage wine glasses have a very subtle paneling running up the glass and fantastic coloring.  They are a smokey gray color, with a brown hue depending on the lighting. Although my mother argues that they have a purple hue to them!! :)

No markings on them, so I am not sure of the maker or date of manufacture 
I am guessing that they are from the 80s. 

VERY GOOD vintage condition - no chips, cracks or water scaling.  The rims are smooth to the touch. Glass has a great shine  - no cloudiness seen. Note - when you hold them up to direct light, you can see some slight surface scratching on a couple  of the pieces.

VERY GOOD vintage condition considering their age!!!  
Handles are delicate and should be carefully handled when washing- using cool water... I had one come off in my hand because I wasn't gentle enough and used hot water  :( Im wondering if they used a glue to secure them on  the cups??  I have taken a photo of the handle up close for you to look at . 
Glaze is intact and there is NO crackling - I washed each piece and no water seeped through the glaze on any of the pieces.   No chips, cracks, staining or repairs.

How to care for your Hat :

*Always handle your hat by the brim. (Do not pinch the crown to pick it up as this will result in misshapen crowns and may split the felt.)

*Never rest your hat on its brim. Always turn it upside down and set it on the crown, so that the brim doesn’t flatten out.

*Clean your hat regularly using a soft bristle brush or a hat sponge.

*Brush counter clockwise with the nap, starting at the bow. If you get caught in the rain, turn the sweatband out and let the hat stand on the crown until dry.

*Never apply direct heat to your hat as this will cause it to shrink and/or lose it’s shape.

* Always store your hat in a hat box to help keep it clean and looking new.

VERY GOOD  preowned condition- no stains, tears or damage ! Slight piling of the yarn is noted in places - particularly along the edge of the piece.   Some stray hairs are noted on the piece - I am not sure if this was from the owner or a pet.  I can't guarantee that it came from a pet free home - just in case that is an issue for you!

Fun Fact : 
Tiffin is a popular United States glass manufacturer with a history dating back to 1888 with A. J. Beatty & Sons and the U. S. Glass Company. The company was purchased by Interpace and produced a line of glassware (Madeira) to complement the Franciscan dinnerware patterns. The final end came to the company in 1980 when production ceased.

"Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket Striped Brown orange gold green Retro sofa throw / blanket Mid Century Lodge decor","Beautifully crafted Large vintage 70s hand crocheted afghan blanket with a striped pattern! 

Measures approximately : 68 "" long x 42"" wide with a 4"" fringe  ~. the material is stretchy. These measurements are when the blanket is not pulled tight. 

Made of an easy care type of yarn but I'm not sure of the fiber content - I am guessing it is a polyester/cotton/rayon mix. It is a thinner yarn than most, so the blanket is lighter and not super thick.
